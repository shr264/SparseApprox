This package provides a Matlab (object-oriented) implementation of Bayesian CCA.
Parameter estimation and prediction of Bayesian CCA are demonstrated using visual image reconstruction data from Miyawaki et al. 2008.

###Contents:###
- vbBCCA/  	
 - Bayesian CCA source code.
- script/		
 - Examples; parameter estimation, visual image reconstruction and identification.
- data/		
 - Visual images and corresponding fMRI data for area V1.
